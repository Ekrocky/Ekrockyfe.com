    <p><font color="white"><b>Eid ul-Fitr, also known as "Festival of Breaking the Fast," is one of the most significant and joyous Islamic holidays celebrated by Muslims around the world. It marks the conclusion of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting and spiritual reflection.</p>
    <p>Eid ul-Fitr is a time of communal prayer, feasting, and social gatherings, where Muslims come together with family and friends to celebrate the end of a month of fasting from dawn until sunset.</p>
    <p>It is a day of gratitude, forgiveness, and charity, as Muslims are encouraged to give to those in need and mend strained relationships. The festivities typically include special prayers at the mosque, the exchange of gifts, wearing new clothes, and indulging in delicious traditional dishes.</p>
    <p>Above all, Eid ul-Fitr represents a renewal of faith and a sense of unity among the global Muslim community.</p>
