    <p><font color="green"><b>Holi, known as the "Festival of Colors," is a vibrant and exuberant Hindu festival celebrated with great enthusiasm throughout India and by the Indian diaspora worldwide. It typically falls in the spring, symbolizing the victory of good over evil and the arrival of springtime's vibrant colors. </p>
    <p>The highlight of Holi is the playful and joyous tradition of throwing colored powders and water at each other, resulting in a riot of hues and laughter. People come together with friends and family to dance to lively music, savor delicious sweets and snacks, and partake in the colorful revelry.</p>
    <p>Holi transcends cultural and religious boundaries, bringing people of all backgrounds together in the spirit of unity and happiness. It is a time for forgiveness, renewal of relationships, and a reminder of the importance of joy and positivity in our lives.</p>
