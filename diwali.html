    <p><font color="orange"><b> Diwali, also known as the "Festival of Lights," is one of the most widely celebrated and significant festivals in India and among Hindu communities worldwide. This joyous festival typically falls in October or November and spans five days of colorful and symbolic rituals. </p>
    <p>Diwali signifies the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil, with the lighting of lamps and candles symbolizing the dispelling of ignorance and the awakening of knowledge. Families clean and decorate their homes, exchange gifts, and create intricate rangoli designs on their doorsteps. </p>
    <p>Fireworks light up the night sky, and delicious sweets and snacks are shared among loved ones. Diwali also holds deep religious and spiritual significance, with prayers offered to various deities, especially Goddess Lakshmi, the bringer of wealth and prosperity.</p>
    <p>The atmosphere during Diwali is filled with warmth, togetherness, and a sense of renewal, making it a time of joy, reflection, and the strengthening of bonds among family and friends.</p>
